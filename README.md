# Kennings Manager

  - Ken, kent, kenning, etc. are used heavily in some parts of Scotland as knowledge about, understanding, perception.
  - This app is the needed support utility for my [ATOM EDITOR](https://atom.io/) macro snippet mashup package "Kennings" which older members of my family used in place of the concept most Americans think of as snippets, little pieces of knowledge that make life easier in some way.
    - I have tried to use generic Linux directory names like `~` instead of `/home/user`
  - I have zero idea how to make this app usable on a modern Windows system, and I can probably work with you if you have an idea how to get around on your system.
  - This app is personalized to the absolute, probably much more useful if you fork it and change it to meet your needs than as it comes.
  - I make heavy use of my CF Python package
